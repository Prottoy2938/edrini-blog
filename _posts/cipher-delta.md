> Cipher Delta web application that helps encode and decode plain content.

### How its Build

### Additional Features

<div className="mt-10"> </div>

> <div class="text-yellow-900">Secure Key Generation</div>

<div className="mt-10"> </div>

If you want to get a secure key, you can generate it from the app.

To generate a secure key, can go to `drawer` -> `Secure Encryption Key`, and the new key will be copied to your clipboard.

Or you can just click the `*` button under the encryption input field, this will generate a new key and also apply it.

The code that used to generate this key was taken from from this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1349426/12966479) answer.

<div className="mt-20"> </div>

> <div class="text-purple-600">Dark Mode</div>

<div className="mt-10"> </div>

To enable, go to -> `drawer` -> `appearance`.

Theme mode preference would be saved on the browser, so the next time you visit the app, it will have the same theme that you had selected.
